# Sequence_Detector-ECE273
Design a system to detect a sequence of inputs. <br>
The system will monitor one input and it will control one output.<br>
The system shall be designed to detect the sequence 1101. <br>
If the system detects this sequence, it should toggle the state of its output. <br>
I must design the sequence detector two different ways; one using Mealy (using JK flip flops) and the other using Moore (using T flip flops) type state machines with minimal number of states.<br> <br>
Files available are:<br>
  1) Pdf report that conatins all of the below, and more, along with the procedure <br>
  2) PlanAhead Generated Physical constraints(UCF file) <br>
  3) Test bench code to test a few sample example <br>
  4) Main binary file(.bit) that is then flashed onto board for Demo <br>
  5) Module to demostrate functionality of flip flops <br>
  6) Pictures of the main schematic and waveforms <br> <br>
  _Note that all labs are required to have an example test bench and waveforms to display theoretical sucess along with a demo to demonstrate actaul success_
